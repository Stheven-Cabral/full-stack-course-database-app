# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree REST API Project

## Overview of the Provided Project Files
In this project, I created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

I used Node.js and Express to create API routes and the Sequelize ORM for data modeling and validation. I used the relational database management system SQLite to view my database. To test the application, I used Postman, a popular application for exploring and testing REST APIs.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) or use a development platform such as Postman [https://www.postman.com/](https://www.postman.com/).
