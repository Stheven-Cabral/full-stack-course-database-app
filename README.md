# full-stack-course-database-app

 Tenth Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree Project

A course database application that provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
