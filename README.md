# full-stack-course-database-app

 Tenth Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree Project

A full stack application that provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

The client was created using react and create-react-app and the REST API was build using Express and Sequelize.

# Instructions for Running the Application

In your preferred terminal, navigate to the 'api' folder and then enter:
### `npm install`

After all dependancies have installed, start the REST API by entering the following in your terminal:
